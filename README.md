# Orange-Dataset-Analysis-with-R

The dataset that is going to be analyzed is called "Orange‚Äù. It is a data frame that has 35
rows and 3 columns of records of the growth of orange trees. 3 variables are: "tree", "age",
"circumference". The aim of this data set is to show whether the circumference of a given tree
gets larger as the tree gets older. "tree" variable consists of 5 different numbers: 1,2,3,4,5.
These are the numbers given to recognize each tree, meaning that 5 trees were observed in
order to make this research. Each tree`s circumference levels are given with their age.


My research questions are,
1. To find whether a tree`s circumference gets larger as it gets older.
2. If so, which tree gets more larger (than others do) as it gets older?
